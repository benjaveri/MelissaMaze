MellissaMaze
============

Introduction
------------

A remake of the old ZX81 Mazogs game by Don Priestley. My ten-year old Melissa
provided original artwork way back when she was 4.

This is my first app using Slick2D (http://slick.ninjacave.com/)

This is a weekend project. Progress happens when it happens.

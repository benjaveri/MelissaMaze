MellissaMaze
============

Introduction
------------

A remake of the old ZX81 Mazogs game by Don Priestley. My ten-year old Melissa
provided original artwork way back when she was 4.

This is my first app using Slick2D (http://slick.ninjacave.com/)

This is a weekend project. Progress happens when it happens.


License
-------

I have not decided on a source/reuse license. If it matters to you,
 contact me.

MelissaMaze application and artwork copyright (c) 2009-2014 by the
 De Waal family. All Rights reserved

Slick2D is licensed under the BSD license

A full license disclosure will be done at publication. Maven includes
 lots of goodies and it takes some effort to figure out what they
  are.

Copyleft licenses frowned upon.


Build
-----

$ mvn package

output will be a zip file in the target/ folder you can unzip and run
 on Mac, Linux or Windows.

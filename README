MellissaMaze
============

CURRENT STATUS
--------------

The code builds fine but has trouble running due to some lwjgl difficulties
Whe I run it from intellij, it works fine. So fare it only draws the maze, no
further interaction has been coded. That is for next weekend ;-)


Introduction
------------

A remake of the old ZX81 Mazogs game. My six-year old Melissa provided the artwork

It is my first Scala program and my first attempt at OpenGL through the LWJGL

It is a weekend project. It may be a useful reference for you, but it has not
enjoyed all the rigour one would put into production code.

I have not decided on a source/reuse license. If it matters to you, contact me

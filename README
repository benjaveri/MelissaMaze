MellissaMaze
============

CURRENT STATUS
--------------

windows: works
mac:     works
linux:   works

So far it only draws the maze, no further interaction has been coded. That is 
for next weekend ;-)


Introduction
------------

A remake of the old ZX81 Mazogs game by Don Priestley. My six-year old Melissa 
provided the artwork way back when she was 4.

It is my first Scala program and my first attempt at OpenGL through the LWJGL

This is a weekend project. It may be a useful reference for you, but it has not 
enjoyed all the rigour one would put into production code. It does not
however suffer from over optimization and attention to details that doesnt
affect the objectives of the program. So let this be the example it sets ;-)

MellissaMaze
============

Introduction
------------

A remake of the old ZX81 Mazogs game. My six-year old Melissa provided the artwork

It is my first Scala program and my first attempt at OpenGL through the LWJGL

It is a weekend project. It may be a useful reference for you, but it has not
enjoyed all the rigour one would put into production code

I have not decided on a reuse license. It it matters to you, contact me

* Scala compiler
* scons


Build and Run
-------------
